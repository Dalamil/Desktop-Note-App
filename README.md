## Installation / Setup
<br>

Build the project in Visual Studio (recommended) or another suitable IDE of choice with access to NuGet packages and install the "System.Data.SQLite.Core" package.
<br>

Without modifying the specified filepath, a database file (**"NotesDB.db"**) needs to be present in the same directory as the application file in order to store the notes data.


<br>

- Install a database manager like DB Browser or SQLiteStudio to manually edit the entries
- May require .NET version **6.0** or later
